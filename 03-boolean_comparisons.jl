# Boolean operators

# && (AND)

true && false

# || (OR)

true || false

# ! (NOT)

!true

# Why && / || instead of & / |

# Because single and and vertical bar are the bitwise operators
# So he recommends that using double and and n percent 

# && &

# Numerical comparisons

# Equality: == and !=

5 != 5.0

# Less than: < and <=

5 <= 5

# Greater than: > and >=

10 ≥ 2

(10 < 2) && (5 > 2) || (5 > 2)
!((10 < 2) && (5 > 2) || (5 > 2))
